Search Any Documentation using Natural Language based chat 

This program uses OpenAI's LLMs and existing documentation to ask and search for information through tons of text. 
It uses the simple old "text-davinci-003" model of openAI for this task and pulls the specified document from your google drive to search through.

Currently its a working prototype, and no intervention is provided for security of information, so pls share with caution.
